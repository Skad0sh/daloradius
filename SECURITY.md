How to disclose potential security issues
============

As DaloRadius does not have a domain or a dedicated contact apart from its Github repository for reporting security issues, to prevent
disclosing security issues publically, please create an Issue about the security issue with means to contact you. 
We will reach out to you as soon as possible. You are not allowed to post publically about the security issue unless and until a fix is rolled out by the DaloRadius team.
